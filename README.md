Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends
# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project Explain the purpose of this analysis.
### Purpose
	
The purpose of this analysis is to compare different Kickstarter campaigns according to their launch dates and funding goals. The significance of this to create reasonable future funding goals based on past years successful months of achieving goals and if and how this correlates with launch and duration of a fundraiser. 

## Analysis and Challenges Explain how you performed your analysis using images and links to code, as well as any challenges you encountered and how you overcame them. If you had no challenges, describe any possible challenges or difficulties that could be encountered.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

Based on the dataset, a little more than half of the fundraisers were successful in reaching their goals all in all. While the other half being failed and canceled fundraisers. Majority of fundraisers are able to raise enough funds. May through July were toe to toe in the success of reaching their financial goals with all categories accounted for. Both successful and failed outcomes were significantly higher in numbers than canceled. Showing that most fundraisers stuck it through to the end to see the final outcome.

When filtering for only the theater category this held somewhat true. May was still a highly successful month for theater with June and July following behind. Theatre outcomes mimic the trend of cancelled outcomes being significantly lower than the successful and failed outcomes, which still made up more than half the data.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

In analyzing outcomes based on goals it shows that the lower financial goals were more likely to succeed than higher financial goals. Goals less than 1 thousand dollars only 24% of them failed or were canceled making it the most successful financial goal. While goals greater than 5000 failed or were canceled 83% of the time.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

I experienced some difficulties throughout this project. For instance, when doing the outcomes based on goals sheet editing the information in the cell box to fit the categories I kept getting flagged so when I clicked on help and then show formula. I was stuck with the formula and know how to get the value back. I created a new sheet and copied the data I already did. Another one was with the module and having to find the averages. I’m still not sure what went wrong but I ended up using the subtotal function and using the average function within it [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Jxm6WINkfQ]. Another one was with the third chart even though it’s the same data it does look a bit different because I’m going up every 10% while the challenge picture is every 20. I also didn’t know how to calculate a percentage, so I found a website through google [https://www.ablebits.com/office-addins-blog/2015/01/14/calculate-percentage-excel-formula/
]. I also used Microsoft’s website for the year function when extracting the year out the rest of the date[https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/year-function-c64f017a-1354-490d-981f-578e8ec8d3b9]. I ended up having to sort data on the outcome goals table because it was completely scrambled using this video to help me [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhMsISMhvB0&t=57s]

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

One conclusion I can draw from the outcomes based on launch date is that more people are able to fundraising because there aren’t holidays that are completely consumer based so it’s easier to get funds.
Another conclusion, is that most fundraisers are not cancelled because fundraisers are hoping to successful reach their goal whether through kickstart or another platform as well. 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

I can conclude that lower goals do fairly well because the financial goal does not scare off potential backers as the increase can make others feel like they have to contribute more and less likely to back.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

One limitation in the data is that US accounts for the majority of the data Singapore literally has 1 fundraiser with Great Britain as the second country taking most of the data. The countries data aren’t distributed evenly. 
Also, this is just for one platform, The campaign could be fundraising on multiple platforms, so the campaign might not have actually failed or been cancelled in reality. 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

The duration of the fundraisers compared to goals to see if a week or a month of fundraising makes a difference in goals. Also, create a table that compares currency to outcomes, seeing if the strength of the currency matter if a campaign will be successful or not.
